## Overview

What exactly does this repository contain?


Well, have you ever been in the mood to learn something new? Maybe are bored and have nothing better to do?

You get some say in how random this is by choosing a category such as music or business.

When you click on 'Inform Me Randomly!', you will be provided with a news article.
