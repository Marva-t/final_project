What exactly does this repository contain?


Well, have you ever been in the mood to learn something new? Maybe are bored and have nothing better to do?
Meet the random news generator.

You get some say in how random this is by choosing a category such as music or business.

When you click on 'Inform Me Randomly!', you will be provided with a news article.

There will be a short excerpt along with the title, author, date, source and link to the full article.

I'm expecting 2 main views. One view is 'New', where you get to pick the category and click on the button to randomly select you an article. The second will be 'Show', where you get to view the details of the randomly selected article.

Techie Tech Requirements:

1. Choosing a category.
2. Randomly pulling a news article from that category.


I'm not sure ^^^^ if that's right but we will start there.
